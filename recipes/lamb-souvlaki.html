        <h3>Lamb Souvlaki</h3>
        <p>Tender pieces of lamb, marinated in a Greek lemon vinaigrette, threaded on skewers and char-grilled to perfection. I like to serve these with rosemary garlic roasted potatoes, a Greek salad, and pita bread.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 pounds boneless leg of lamb, trimmed of all fat and cut into 1-inch cubes></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, oregano, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl. Add cubed lamb and stir until all of the lamb is coated with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate 3 hours, or overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Thread marinated lamb onto skewers, reserving any remaining marinade. Grill skewers until desired doneness, 10 to 12 minutes, basting with the reserved marinade and turning occasionally for even cooking.</li>
        </ol>
